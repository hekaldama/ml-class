== Supervised Learning (video_id=3)
* Supervised Learning: "right answers" given. E.g. housing pricing, put a
                       parabolic line or straight line and determine.
* Regression output problem: Continuous value E.g. how many products will sell
                             over the next 3 months.
* Classification problem: discrete valued output (0 or 1). E.g. tumors

== Unsupervised Learning (video_id=4)
* Unsupervised Learning: here is a data set, can you determine something from it
                         Unmarked data. Clustering data. E.g. google news
* Octave is helpful for quickly learning ML

== Modal Repressentation
* Variables: m == amount of training data ; h == hypothesis of a learning
            algorithm
* Univariate linear regression: Linear regression with one variable. One variable
                                might be the housing pricing example.
